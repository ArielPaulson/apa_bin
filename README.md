# Purpose

This is a mirror of my work directory /home/apa/local/bin/, mainly so that I can rapidly share something with people outside of work.

Script ages span 2007-present.

Some of these are documented / annotated, some are not.

Some of these are thoroughly tested, some are not.

Someday in the future, most of these will become well-formatted, well-annotated, and completely conform to best practices.

The majority have been developed in a CentOS6/7, x86_64, bash 4 environment.  Those intended for queued environments expect SGE + mpich2.

Updates are made periodically.

Nothing is guaranteed; caveat emptor!
