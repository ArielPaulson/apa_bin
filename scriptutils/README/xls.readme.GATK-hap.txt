How to read haploid *.GT columns:
  GT (genotype) columns typically have 1-2 numbers separated by slashes, indicating allele(s) found and zygosity.
  Number 0 always stands for the reference allele; numbers 1-N stand for alternate alleles discovered.
  Haploid values are mostly 0 or 1, indicating that position agreed with reference (0), or alternate allele (1); if any values > 1, then > 1 allele was found at that site (due to heterogeneous samples or multi-sample calling).


How to read haploid *.AD and *.RP columns:
  AD (Allele Depth) fields have 1-2 numbers separated by commas, indicating read coverage supporting reference and non-reference calls.
  RP (Reference Percent) is always the first number over the sum of the two (multiplied by 100).
  For example AD value “2,19” indicates 2 reads supported ref and 19 reads did not; the associated RP value is 100*2/(2+19) = 9.52381.
