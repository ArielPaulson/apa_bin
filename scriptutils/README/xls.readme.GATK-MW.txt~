How to read diploid+ *.GT columns:
	Diploid GT (genotype) columns typically have 2-3 numbers separated by slashes, indicating allele(s) found and zygosity.
  Multiploid GT columns could concievably have as many numbers as the allowed ploidy, although such a hyper-variable position would be very rare.
	Number 0 always stands for the reference allele; numbers 1-N stand for alternate alleles discovered.
	Diploid organisms have 1 or more other numbers, indicating non-ref alleles.  Pooled samples may have > 2 alleles at a site, resulting in 3 numbers (and very rarely, 4 or more).
	Common diploid GT values: “0/0” (homozygous ref), “1/1” (homozygous alt), “0/1” (heterozygous, 1 ref and 1 alt), “./.” (genotype undetectable – no coverage)
	Rarer diploid GT values with pooled samples: “2/2” (homozygous alt, alternate allele #2), “1/2” (heterozygous alt, alternate alleles 1 and 2), “0/2” (heterozygous, 1 ref and 1 alt allele #2)


How to read diploid+ *.AD and *.RP columns:
	Diploid AD (Allele Depth) fields typically have 2-3 numbers separated by commas, indicating read coverage supporting various alleles.
  Like the GT columns, there will be one number per allele called per position.  A pair of GT and AD fields will always have the same number of numbers.
  The first value is always ref; values 2-N are for the alternate alleles.  Number of alternate alleles reported should be reflected in the genotype calls at that position.
  RP (Reference Percent) is always the first number over the sum of all numbers (multiplied by 100).
Examples:
	AD value “0,19” indicates 0 reads supported ref and 19 reads supported alt – this is a homozygote, and the corresponding GT field should be “1/1”, homozygous alt.  RP is 0.
	AD value “7,0” indicates 7 reads supported ref and 0 reads supported alt – this is also a homozygote, and the corresponding GT field should be “0/0”, homozygous ref.  RP is 100.
	AD value “2,2” indicates 2 reads supported ref and 2 reads supported alt – this is a heterozygote, and the corresponding GT field should be “0/1”.  Also this call is weak, since the total depth is only 4.  RP is 50.
	AD value “1,200,15” indicates a multi-allele heterozygous position, with 1 read supporting ref, 200 supporting alt allele #1, and 15 supporting alt allele #2.  GT fields at this position will be some combination of 0, 1, and 2.  RP is 0.462963.
